Why is it important?
Programming in the ML world is very different from traditional software development. ML technology has 3 major components - model, compute & and data; Recent advances in GPU has made compute infinite while algorithms behind AI are evolving to a point where they would mostly become commoditised building block like libraries/functions in software development. For all practical purposes, ML engineers follow a virtuous cycle of labelling data, training models & and testing them. Now, throughout the last 20 years of web development, we built a lot of tooling like Git & and IDEs to help software developers write, version & and manage vast amounts of code efficiently. Now, if code to software dev is labelled data to ML, is there a need for Github of Software 2.0? Absolutely. ML end up spending 70% of their time managing/curating datasets. There‚Äôs a very strong need for one platform to curate, maintain & and label datasets and all related services around it. Playment fills this need.

What makes you a good fit

If you can write code that works, we should be good but read on (disclaimer: most of what follows is not a hard requirement);

You've built efficient, reusable code backed by solid test coverage in React or Vue.js (Brownie points if you have worked with state management libraries like Redux);

You've built backend architectures using Node.js & Postgres (Brownie points if you‚Äôve worked with Serverless & Prisma);

You can write tests, are great at logging {by great logging we don‚Äôt mean embarrassing console logs} & error tracking using tools like Sentry;

Most of the above is us trying to sound legit about our stack, so if you‚Äôve not worked with some of it & are open to learning or have better ideas, it‚Äôs totally cool;

That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002.

Help define the public face of a next-generation intelligence platform ‚Äî fast, elegant, and built from the ground up.

About Noumena
Noumena is an AI research lab and product company focused on usable intelligence. We‚Äôre building tightly integrated systems that reason, adapt, and evolve in context‚Äîstarting with tools we use ourselves to accelerate research and product development. These tools generate high-signal feedback loops that power the training of the next generation of high-performance, specialized models.

We design, own, and operate the full stack‚Äîfrom infrastructure to interface. Every layer is designed to work together, compounding in capability, precision, and feedback over time. The result is not just smarter models‚Äîbut systems that actually work in practice.

About the Role
We‚Äôre hiring a Platform Web Developer Engineer to own and shape the connective tissue between Noumena and the world. You‚Äôll define the surfaces that developers touch first‚Äîour marketing site, docs, onboarding flows, auth systems, and billing stack‚Äîand ensure they‚Äôre as fast, expressive, and thoughtful as the systems behind them.

This isn‚Äôt just frontend work. It‚Äôs product-defining engineering at the intersection of design, infrastructure, and developer experience. You‚Äôll craft the first experience developers have with Noumena‚Äîand the foundation for everything that follows.

What You‚Äôll Own
Build and maintain Noumena‚Äôs public-facing surfaces: site, docs, onboarding flows, and user-facing platform tools
Implement secure and seamless authentication, access control, and billing systems (OAuth, IAM, Stripe, etc.)
Collaborate closely with design and product to bring brand direction to life in performant, scalable interfaces
Own architectural decisions and dev experience for all web-facing platform work
Integrate analytics, performance instrumentation, and observability across the stack
Help define how Noumena‚Äôs interfaces evolve alongside our models, tooling, and usage loops

You May Be a Good Fit If You:
Have deep experience with React, Next.js, TypeScript, and modern frontend/web practices
Have built robust authentication and billing flows in production
Understand great developer UX‚Äîacross onboarding, docs, and product interaction
Think of interface work as a strategic surface, not an afterthought
Care deeply about accessibility, performance, and polish
Thrive in small, high-agency teams where ownership is high and velocity matters

Strong Candidates May Also Have Experience With:
Developer-facing platforms, tools, or public APIs
Identity systems like Clerk, NextAuth, or Auth0
Billing tools such as Stripe, Paddle, Metronome, or Orb
Design systems (e.g. Chakra UI, Tailwind) or documentation frameworks (e.g. Storybook, MDX)
Performance tuning for global audiences
SEO optimization and analytics integration
Technical writing or developer education content

Why This Role Matters
You‚Äôll be defining the front door to a new kind of AI system. This role is about more than polish‚Äîit‚Äôs about building trust, clarity, and momentum. It‚Äôs the frontend of a frontier.

Team & Culture
We‚Äôre a small, senior team that values autonomy, sharp thinking, and low-ego collaboration. We care deeply about craft‚Äîboth in what we build and how we work. We‚Äôre remote-flexible, with a preference for Bay Area-based engineers who can join regular in-person shaping sessions.",0,Needs an AI,Unknown,Unknown,Previous resume,True,Unknown,2025-07-03 08:29:35.277797,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4219560841,Easy Applied,"{('mobile phone number', '7975708160', 'text', '7975708160'), ('Are you legally authorized to work in the United States?
