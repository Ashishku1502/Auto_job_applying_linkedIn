Job Title: Senior Full Stack Developer (Backend-Heavy | Agent Deployment Focus)

Location: Bangalore / Hybrid
Company: DecisionX
Type: Full-Time


About DecisionX

DecisionX is pioneering a new category: the world’s first Decision AI — an AI Super-Agent that helps high-growth teams make smarter, faster decisions by turning fragmented data into clear next steps.
From bold bets in the boardroom to cross-functional decisions across Sales, Marketing, Product, and Engineering — down to the micro-decisions that power daily execution — Decision AI becomes your invisible co-pilot: thinking with you, acting ahead of you, and evolving beyond you.
Role Overview

We’re looking for a Senior Full Stack Developer with a strong backend orientation to power the intelligence layer of DecisionX. You’ll be responsible for building scalable APIs, deploying LLMs and reasoning engines, and orchestrating multi-agent systems behind the scenes — while also contributing to clean, interactive front-end experiences.
Key Responsibilities

Architect and build backend services that support AI agent workflows, decision logic, and orchestration.
Deploy and manage LLMs and agent frameworks (e.g., LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen) into production environments.
Design scalable APIs to serve decision insights and automate workflows across tools like Salesforce, HubSpot, and Snowflake.
Implement modular microservices for data ingestion, vector memory management, and real-time reasoning.
Collaborate with AI engineers to operationalize models, build custom tools, and manage infrastructure.
Contribute to modern front-end features using React (Next.js) for delivering real-time decision support.
Ensure security, observability, and performance of deployed models and APIs.
Must-Have Skills

8-10 years of experience in backend-heavy full stack development.
Strong backend expertise in Node.js, TypeScript, Express/NestJS.
Experience in deploying and scaling LLMs and agent architectures in production (OpenAI, Claude, Mistral).
Working knowledge of LangChain, AutoGen, or custom agent orchestration frameworks.
Solid grasp of REST/GraphQL APIs, microservices, and cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCP, or similar).
Deep experience with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or warehouse integrations.
Familiarity with vector databases (e.g., FAISS, Weaviate, Chroma) and embedding models.
Ability to build secure, event-driven systems with queues, WebSockets, or real-time triggers.
Nice-to-Have

Hands-on experience with model fine-tuning, RAG systems, or prompt optimization.
Exposure to CI/CD, Docker, Kubernetes, and monitoring tools like Grafana or Datadog.
Familiarity with frontend development in React, TailwindCSS, and building agent-facing UI layers.
What You’ll Get

Ownership of core system architecture at a high-growth AI startup.
Collaborate with a sharp, mission-driven founding team.
Opportunity to push the frontier in agentic reasoning and decision automation.
Competitive salary, early equity, and long-term wealth-building upside.

About Codewalla:
Codewalla is not your typical software shop.
We’re a New York–born, AI-native product studio with a growing base in Pune. Our mission? To help the world’s most ambitious startups and scaleups build products that move fast, scale well, and make a dent in their industries.

We integrate AI tools into every layer of our workflow—from design to code to deployment—making our teams faster, smarter, and more focused on solving real problems.
If you’re tired of slow decision-making and want your code to make it to production faster than in big enterprises, this is the place for you.

What You’ll Work On:
Design, develop, and deploy scalable web applications using Node.js, Express.js, and React.js
Architect and consume RESTful and GraphQL APIs
Implement efficient and reliable databases using PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB
Write clean, maintainable, and testable code following modern JavaScript (ES6+) and TypeScript best practices
Integrate cloud services and serverless functions on AWS, GCP, or Azure
Manage deployment pipelines with Docker and CI/CD workflows
Collaborate closely with designers and product managers to deliver intuitive, high-performance UIs
Participate in agile ceremonies: sprint planning, estimation, reviews, and retrospectives
Leverage AI development tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and ChatGPT to accelerate your workflow
Troubleshoot, debug, and continuously optimize for performance and scalability


What Makes You a Great Fit:
5–10 years of experience in full stack web development
Proficiency in Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and modern JavaScript/TypeScript
Solid understanding of SQL databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and NoSQL solutions (MongoDB)
Experience working with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and Dockerized environments
Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and Git workflows
Comfort working in fast-moving, agile startup environments with distributed teams
Strong communication and collaboration skills—able to work effectively with non-engineering stakeholders
Bonus: Exposure to AI tools in the dev workflow (Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.)
Bonus: Experience with GraphQL, microservices, or serverless architecture


Pay Range & Compensation Package:
We offer a competitive compensation package aligned with your experience and the impact you bring to the team. Details will be discussed during the interview process.


Why Join Codewalla?
Work on products that go live fast and get used globally
Build in an AI-native development environment with tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and LLM-based code analyzers
Collaborate directly with US-based founders, designers, and cross-functional teams
 Shape the architecture, not just write tickets, true ownership from day one
Be part of a no-silos, high-trust, feedback-driven engineering culture
See your work move the needle on business goals and user impact


Inclusion Matters:
We’re an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all team members.

Integrate cloud services and serverless functions on AWS, GCP, or Azure
Manage deployment pipelines with Docker and CI/CD workflows
Collaborate closely with designers and product managers to deliver intuitive, high-performance UIs
Participate in agile ceremonies: sprint planning, estimation, reviews, and retrospectives
Leverage AI development tools like GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and ChatGPT to accelerate your workflow
Troubleshoot, debug, and continuously optimize for performance and scalability


What Makes You a Great Fit:
5–10 years of experience in full stack web development
Proficiency in Node.js, Express.js, React.js, and modern JavaScript/TypeScript
Solid understanding of SQL databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL) and NoSQL solutions (MongoDB)
Experience working with cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and Dockerized environments
Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines and Git workflows
Comfort working in fast-moving, agile startup environments with distributed teams
Strong communication and collaboration skills—able to work effectively with non-engineering stakeholders
Bonus: Exposure to AI tools in the dev workflow (Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.)
Bonus: Experience with GraphQL, microservices, or serverless architecture


Pay Range & Compensation Package:
We offer a competitive compensation package aligned with your experience and the impact you bring to the team. Details will be discussed during the interview process.


Why Join Codewalla?
Work on products that go live fast and get used globally
Build in an AI-native development environment with tools like Copilot, ChatGPT, and LLM-based code analyzers
Collaborate directly with US-based founders, designers, and cross-functional teams
 Shape the architecture, not just write tickets, true ownership from day one
Be part of a no-silos, high-trust, feedback-driven engineering culture
See your work move the needle on business goals and user impact


Inclusion Matters:
We’re an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all team members.
